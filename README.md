# chrismiller-mids.github.io

Chris Miller is a name a no longer use, but this was a weekend project to recreate Conway's game of life using JavaScript and Angular, hosted on github.io for ease of access. Were I to do this today, I'd write it in TypeScript and React, and I'd stick to a much more functional paradigm, as the nested `for` statements are cringeworthy.  The endpoint no longer appears to work, as I believe changine my handle to reflect my new identity broke something internally.
